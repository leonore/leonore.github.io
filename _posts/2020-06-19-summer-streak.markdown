Throughout this summer I will be hoping to keep a streak of git commits so that I can stay up to date with my coding skills while I wait for employment to start this September.

Today, 19/06/20, I:
* finished fixing my tmux bindings
* designed the tmux status bar nicely
* cleaned up some scripts
* committed it all.

I want to:
* keep a lookout for jobs (lol)
* finish updating my CV
* make a list of parts I need for my air quality monitoring Go + Raspberry Pi project
* look into C++ gaming programming tutorials
