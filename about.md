Graduated (with a lack of ceremony) with a degree in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow in 2020. Decided to live in London long-term after the summer of 2019 interning for a hedge fund. I am currently working as a Back End Engineer at Thought Machine, where I am increasingly favouring Golang over Python. I like design things, picking the best playlist covers for Spotify playlists, and playing football.
